									Women with PCOS can be at risk of serious psychological disorders
								</p>
							</header>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p>
								PCOS is associated with an increased risk of diagnosis of depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder. It is associated with worse symptoms of depression, anxiety, OCD, and somatization. Screening for these disorders to allow early intervention may be warranted.

								<p>
									Most of the research on PCOS and mental health has focused on depression and anxiety, but it may also be associated with an increased risk of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder, and eating disorders.
								</p>
								<p>

									People with PCOS who have anxiety or depression may have lower levels of certain neurotransmitters (chemicals that send signals throughout the brain and nervous system). Neurotransmitters like serotonin (a chemical messenger within the nervous system that is associated with positive feelings) play an important role in depression and anxiety. One study showed that people with PCOS who have low levels of serotonin and other neurotransmitters report more symptoms of depression and anxiety.

									<h3>Some Ways To Improve Mental Health </h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									
									<ul>
										<li>Talk about your feelings. Just being listened to can help you feel supported and less alone with any problems you’re going through.</li>
										<li>Get a good night’s sleep. Sleep and mental health are closely linked: mental ill-health can affect your sleep, and poor sleep can affect your mental well-being.</li>
										<li>Eat well. A balanced diet can improve your sense of well-being and your mood.</li>
										<li>Stay active. Physical activity is not only good for your body, but it’s also great for your mind.</li>
										<li>Practice mindfulness, a way to be fully engaged and present in the moment.</li>
										<li>Care for others, whether that’s working on relationships with family, letting go of old grudges or volunteering.</li>
									</ul>
