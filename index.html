						<h2>Lets learn about <strong>PCOS</strong> in a simplified way.</h2>
						<p>
							<b>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder that causes an influx of androgen production in females of reproductive age.</b><br />
							Hormonal Imbalances appear in women from stress, improper diet, and hereditary factors.
							PCOS is estimated to Affect 6 to 17 million women aged 18–44 in the U.S. It is one of the most common causes of infertility. There’s no single test to diagnose PCOS, and there’s no cure. The disorder is typically characterized by an excess production of the hormone testosterone, irregular ovulation, and cysts, or fluid-filled sacs, in the ovaries. <br />
							<b> A nutritious diet with exercise can manage PCOS, but it is recurring when not properly taken care of through lifestyle adaptions.</b>
							Females with this condition experience a lower quality of life because of it's implications on their mental health, overwhelming physical symptoms, and their overall relationship with food.

								PCOS is an invasive disorder that impacts all aspects of a person's life. Luckily, lifestyle changes can suppress PCOS symptoms— presenting the opportunity to lead a healthy, stress-free life.

								PCOS is a condition that is not widely discussed or understood by the general demographic. Often, the symptoms cause stress for women who have not received a precise diagnosis about what they are experiencing. In addition, underdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can prolong the period of uncertainty, even causing symptoms to advance.

								PCOS is a condition that is not widely discussed or understood by the general demographic. Often, the symptoms cause stress for women who have not received a precise diagnosis about what they are experiencing. In addition, underdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can prolong the period of uncertainty, even causing symptoms to advance.  <br />
								At what age does PCOS begin? Symptoms begin displaying around the age of puberty. Females that have not gone through puberty cannot be accurately tested for the condition. Nonetheless, parents can implement preventative measures in the diet and lifestyle of a female child from a young age when there is a family history of PCOS. <br />
								Hyperandrogenism is clinically the most evident indication for PCOS in females. This term indicates excessive androgen production within the female body, causing internal dysfunction. An example of a commonly recognized androgen hormone is testosterone. The outcome of too much testosterone in females is associated with developing inherently male attributes such as coarse hair on the body (chin/face, chest, and all other areas), acne on the skin, and alopecia (or male pattern baldness in severe cases). <br />
								Another significant symptom of PCOS is loss of menstruation or irregular cycles. The lack of consistency in the menstrual cycle is also associated with increased production of androgens. One recommendation doctors make for regularity in periods is through the use of birth control pills. Drugs containing progesterone and estrogen are used to create balance and minimize the appearance of symptoms. However, this suppression does not cure the underlying complications. Additionally, the medication prevents fertility, and this causes further issues for women seeking to get rid of their PCOS but also conceive. When women with PCOS get off hormonal birth control pills, their symptoms return with fierce force.<br />
								A positive perspective is that there are solutions to our problems, remedies within our food and the habits we carry. This condition requires a lot of commitment and time to control. There are always routes and treatments available, but this website does not serve to give medical advice. Instead, you'll find the sources to connect with communities that can help relate to your circumstances—Explore foods that are preventing your best health and how to approach 'dieting.' Lack of nutrition can worsen the symptoms of PCOS just as much as weight gain, the golden balance is in regulating insulin resistance within the body without developing an eating disorder.<br />
								The most neglected symptom of PCOS is its effects on female mental health. This condition is associated with depression, anxiety, and compulsive disorders. One of the most tested and prevalent mental conditions is depression. Let's explore more.
