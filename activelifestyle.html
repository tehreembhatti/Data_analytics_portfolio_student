								Women with PCOS experience higher rates of insulin resistance compared to women who don’t have the condition. Insulin resistance affects your body’s ability to use blood sugar for energy.<br /> <br />

								Doctors have connected a lack of physical activity and excess body weight as potential contributing factors to insulin resistance, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney DiseasesTrusted Source.<br /> <br/>

								Not all women with PCOS have overweight. The good news is physical exercise is something you can do for your health when you have PCOS, regardless of your weightTrusted Source.

									<h3>Different types of physical activity</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									<b>CARDIO</b><br />
									Good for reducing insulin resistance, boosting fertility, stabilising mood

									Moderate exercise like brisk walking, jogging, cycling or swimming are all great activities that can help with PCOS. This type of exercise increases your bodies sensitivity to insulin, which reduces your risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Doing 30 minutes or more a day can also help with weight management, symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as improving frequency of menstrual cycles and ovulation. And if you’re about to start IVF, regular light exercise can boost your reproductive success. Not sure how to start running, easy download the free Nike Run Club app that provides your with guided runs to help you begin your running journey!

								<p>

									<b>STRENGTH TRAINING</b><br />

									Good for reducing insulin resistance, increasing metabolic rate, improving body composition (more muscle and less fat tissue)

									Bodyweight exercises like squats, push-ups, or tricep dips improve the function of insulin in your body, but can also boost your metabolism by building more muscle mass. Don’t worry though; you won’t bulk up unless you’re taking steroids! More muscle simply means burning more calories while exercising, but also throughout the day even at rest. Combining resistance moves with cardio exercise is the best way to ensure you’re building a lean body, achieving a healthy BMI, and reducing your risk of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes.


								</p>
								<p>
									<b>HIGH INTENSITY INTERVAL TRAINING</b><br />

									Good for increasing cardiovascular fitness and decreasing waist circumference

									Intervals involve swapping between short bouts of high intensity work and lower intensity recovery. It’s a time efficient way of boosting your cardiovascular fitness, with extra benefits for PCOS. Going hard on the spin bike burns bucket-loads of calories, and reduces abdominal fat more effectively then say, a brisk walk. This can help you achieve a 5 – 10% weight loss, which studies show can decrease PCOS symptoms by reducing excess testosterone and improving insulin resistance.


								</p>
								<p>

									<b>CORE STRENGTH</b><br />

									Good for general well-being and injury prevention, preparing your body for pregnancy

									Being above your ideal weight can cause lower back pain and poor posture, so including core training in your program is essential. These muscles support the spine and learning how to switch them on ensures you don’t injure yourself during exercise. Also if you’re trying to conceive, start training your pelvic floor muscles! These muscles are also part of your core and help prevent incontinence, boost sexual health, and improve pelvic stability to help support a healthy pregnancy.
