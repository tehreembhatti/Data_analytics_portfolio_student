								<h3>Foods to Avoid</h3>
							</header>
									<p>
										<b>Soy</b> <br /> 
										Soy milk and all other soy products—chunks, tofu and chaap—should be avoided in a PCOS diet. Several studies have indicated that soy is not good for women with polycystic ovarian syndrome because ‘phyto oestrogen’ which can trick bodies into further reducing the production of oestrogen by detecting adequate levels already present.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Dairy</b> <br />
										Milk, paneer, cheese and butter may be a regular part of most people’s lives but are not recommended for women with PCOS. This is because women with PCOS have the propensity to develop insulin resistance and the ingestion of dairy can lead to higher levels of insulin.
									</p>
									<p>
										<b>Refined Flour</b> <br />
										High in carbohydrates and low in fibre, refined flour should be cut out of PCOS diets. This means that white bread, pasta, kulchas, cakes, etc should be avoided as far as possible. White flour is a high glycemic index (something which increases a person’s blood sugar level) food which triggers the release of more insulin when consumed. Since women with PCOS can develop insulin intolerance, flour should generally be avoided.

									<h3>What the Body Needs</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									<b>
										Fruits and Vegetables </b><br />
										Fruit and vegetables are a good source of vitamins and minerals and fibre, and should make up just over a third of the food you eat each day.

										It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.

										There's evidence that people who eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day have a lower risk of heart disease, stroke and some cancers.
								
								<p>
									<b>
										Beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat and other proteins
									</b> <br />
									These foods are all good sources of protein, which is essential for the body to grow and repair itself.<br />

									They're also good sources of a range of vitamins and minerals.<br />

									Meat is a good source of protein, vitamins and minerals, including iron, zinc and B vitamins. It's also one of the main sources of vitamin B12.<br />

									Choose lean cuts of meat and skinless poultry whenever possible to cut down on fat. Always cook meat thoroughly.<br />

									Eggs and fish are also good sources of protein, and contain many vitamins and minerals. Oily fish is particularly rich in omega-3 fatty acids.<br />

									Aim to eat at least 2 portions of fish a week, including 1 portion of oily fish.<br />
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>Healthy Fats</b> <br />
									Some fat in the diet is essential, but on average people in the UK eat too much saturated fat.<br />

									It's important to get most of your fat from unsaturated oils and spreads.<br />

									Swapping to unsaturated fats can help lower cholesterol.<br />

									Remember that all types of fat are high in energy and should be eaten in small amounts.<br />
