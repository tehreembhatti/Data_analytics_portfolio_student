								<b>I decided on this topic for my entrepreneurship project because I was diagnosed with PCOS at 17.</b> The first time I visited an endocrinologist was due to my lack of menstrual cycle and severe depression. The endocrinologist immediately diagnosed me with PCOS, she explained that my hormones were out of balance, and my body produced excessive androgens, thus causing abnormal symptoms.<br />
								But this was not my first time experiencing the effects of PCOS. My journey with PCOS began at the very young age of 12. I had gained a lot of weight and body hair, and by age 16, I had lost my period entirely. Regardless, my pediatrician would dismiss the symptoms, and I was not made aware of my condition until my pediatrician referred me to an endocrinologist.<br />
								My journey to recovery began with weight loss and significant changes in my lifestyle and daily habits. Food was one of the most challenging aspects of my recovery, but physical activity was a blessing.<br />
								With three years of clean eating and working on my mental and physical well-being, I regained my menstrual cycle and controlled my PCOS symptoms. I could finally live happier.<br />
								The most challenging part of my journey was not knowing about my condition while experiencing the symptoms. The idea behind this website was to make a platform with all the necessary information in one place. A website that my younger self would have greatly appreciated.
